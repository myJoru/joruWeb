    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>1. App Overview: Joru is an e-commerce platform designed to facilitate the booking of services such as mehndi design and makeup for various functions. Our app is available on both the Play Store and the App Store, offering a user-friendly and simple interface.</p>
    <p>2. User Responsibilities: Users are responsible for providing accurate booking details, including dates, times, and locations. Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the service without refund</p>
    <p>3. Payment and Refunds: Full payment is required at the time of booking to confirm the service. In case of cancellation by the user, only 90% of the booking amount will be refunded, with a 10% fee retained due to the commitment of our artists for the reserved date. For any payment-related issues, users should contact our customer support team.</p>
    <p>4. Account Management: Users can freely create and delete their accounts. Upon account deletion, all user information is permanently removed from our system.</p>
    <p>5. Purchases and Payments: Users can book multiple services in a single order, ensuring at least a 1-2 day buffer between the booking date and the service date. Cancellations are allowed up to 48 hours before the scheduled service date. Refunds will be processed immediately after cancellation approval, typically taking 1-7 business days to reflect in the userâ€™s account.</p>
